# API-Employee-Directory
 
Unit 08 Project

Utilized Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random "employees". Further proceeded to use that data to build a prototype for employee directory. 

Requested JSON object from the API using fetched and parsed data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid. Displayed information includes thumbnail image, full name, email and location.

Clicking on employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address.
